# stride

<!-- badges: start -->
This R package implements nonparametric estimation of survival models for mixture data.
Mixture data is data collected from multiple populations of interest, but we do not know from which population each observation belongs.  The corresponding references are:

## Installation

You can install the released version of stride from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("stride")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tpgarcia/stride")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(stride)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
